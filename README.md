Hi!

This is a file with preliminary data analysis for the Honours Dissertation Project "Planning Fallacy". This file was meant to assist the research group in their own data analysis in the "Results" section of the dissertation, specifically with the decision-making in statistical tests (e.g. non-parametric/ parametric ANOVA's).
The project focused on cognitive techniques that may mitigate planning fallacy in educational contexts, such as in creating a presentation. 

Honours research group tested planning accuracy in 3 conditions with different interventions strategies (techniques to improve planning) and 
1 control sampling (no intervention) - 15 participants each (N=60).

Results:
1) Significant difference in planning fallacy between experimental and control conditions (p=0.00003).
- Groups with cognitive interventions performed better at planning than the control group (without intervention).
2) In the experimental conditions: significant difference in the pre-intervention and post-intervention planning prediction (p=0.002).
- Post-intervention planning prediction tends to be more accurate relative to the actual time to prepare a presentation
- Intervention could be the factor fostering planning precision - and mitigating planning fallacy

Other quick stats:
* Skills in creating presentations were not found to statistically influence the results (p=0.27)
* None of the experimental conditions were found to be statistically more effective than others (p=0.73) -
but presence of any cognitive intervention statistically improved performance compared to non-presence (control group).

The data analysis includes:
1) Part 1: Demographic data
2) Part 2: Experimental Data
3) Part 3: Other

The file is maily code, with minimal data visualisation.
