planning_efficiency,"I think so, as it forced me to actually think of the steps I needed to take before starting my project, instead of starting it blindly. This allowed me to have a clear sense of direction I wanted to take with the project and eliminated any indecisiveness I could have encountered"
granularity,"I think it did as even though I did not use it, it got me to start thinking about the first way I wanted to approach the task and to remind myself of the different things I had to consider throughout the process"
planning_efficiency,"I think it helped me plan my approach a little -- even if I wasn't explicitly thinking about it, it still probably subconsciously helped to sound it out and have that in my mind somewhere. "
,I make a plan before I start each of my assignments because I find it saves me editing time later to go in with a clear structure of what I want to accomplish. 
subcomponent_awareness,"It helped me visualise the steps of what had to be done and what needed to be tackled, and in case I found myself lost I knew I could rely back on the plan. "
subcomponent_awareness,"Yes, it provided me with clear steps to follow, helping me structure the presentation and aiding time management"
planning_efficiency,More efficient in making the powerpoint when I already knew how I wanted to outline it. Also made research faster 
planning_efficiency,Yes as it helped me save time as I had already planned the task ahead.
subcomponent_awareness,It helped me be a lot more clear before i started looking for academic papers. Made the search for papers a lot easier and more straightforward as I knew exacly What i was looking for. 
subcomponent_awareness,I approach everything I do in this way as it helps breaks down and simplify the approach
planning_efficiency,"Yes, usually before tasks like these, I tend to take time to 'plan' and think about my approach to the task so it did not cary much from my usual approach to tasks like presentations. It was definitely helpful since I got my task done earlier than I thought as well!  "
insight,Started to get initial ideas of what each slide could focus on and what would and wouldn't work
subcomponent_awareness,Yes - having an outline meant I wasnt faffing
planning_efficiency,It helped me have a starting point so i could go straight into it. 
subcomponent_awareness,separated the task into smaller chunks
,"Yes, by working backwards I put more time for tasks that were smaller and till the end"
planning_efficiency,"Yes, it made it seem simpler. I really thought I know what I am gonna do "
planning_efficiency,"Yes, it helped me break down the task and working backwards it kind of was confusing at first but later felt like I was a step ahead. "
,"Yes and no. It was good to break the task down, but going backwards made it confusing. "
goal,It definitely helped anticipate some challenges and by starting with the end goal in my mind I felt like each stepped planned considers this end goal more than usually. 
subcomponent_awareness,Yes it broke down the task and I thought that because it is just 4 slides it won't take that long but then once you start doing it it takes forever to get the result you are happy with
goal,Yes it helped me break down the task and see it from a different perspective . Working backwards was very interesting and helped focus on the goal more
insight,Yes it was interesting but doesn't follow natural thought stream 
goal,"It was great working backwards, something different and made me focus on the end goal more. I could gather most stuff that would build up to it. I think it was very interesting"
insight,"It allowed me to plan and break down the task. Working backwards was unusual and required more energy and focus, but maybe it made me think more about the task. "
,"No because it was somewhat confusing, I made a plan backwards and then worked on a task normally from the beginning"
insight,Yes I think it helped because I could break the task down. It was also very thought provoking because normally you don't think about stuff this way so maybe there was more consideration than usually in planning. 
insight,"Yes yes yes! It was good to plan, put way more effort into it thinking backwards. It wasn't that obvious so you had to pay attention and think what would be the thing before. "
planning_efficiency,Yes it was helpful to break down the task and think about each step. 
planning_efficiency,It was nice to take time to plan and think about what I need to do also interesting different way to do it backwards 
,"Somewhat, I still underestimated how much time I would spend deciding what to include."
,"Not really, my original estimate was already pretty accurate."
detached,yes because i knew what was going to distract me in my current situation by visualising it
,"Not really, I already think of challenges that will occur"
,"Somewhat, but I still underestimated how long certain parts would take."
detached,It helped me remove myself from the situation and think about it more objectively
planning_efficiency,"Yes because it helped me visualize what a wanted to do before I did it, which helped me to structure what i wanted to do better without rambling."
planning_efficiency,"Yes, it made me more aware of how I usually rush to start the task and helped me slow down and plan better."
,"Not too much, I could see how seeing myself from an outside perspective can make you more realistic about time but I have quite a good knowledge of how long these tasks take me"
,"Not really, it didn’t change much for me because I already plan my tasks in detail."
granularity,"Yes, it made me consider small delays that I wouldn’t have thought about before."
structure,"Yes, it made me think ahead rather than just diving into the task without structure."
planning_efficiency,"yes, it made me think ahead and anticipate areas where things might slow me down."
,"Not really, I already plan things out well so I didn’t notice a big difference."
subcomponent_awareness,"Yes, I felt like I had a better sense of the steps i would take but I still ended up overestimating how fast I could work"
